                <h2>Personal life</h2>
                
                <h3>Family</h3>
                <p>I was born and raised in Denmark in a medium sized city called Hiller√∂d, just north of Copenhagen.
                    I have a big brother and a mother and a father who are still happily married and living in my old childhood home.
                </p>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>From the age of 7, I have been doing orienteering which is a running sport where you have to navigate your way thorugh a course in the forest visiting pre-marked points on the way. 
                    I was so good at it that I qualified for the junior national team as 15 years old and won my first World Championship medal at 16. 
                    Since then I have partitipated in 6 Junior World Championship and 3 Senior World Championship, winning 1 individual medal and 4 medals in relay. 
                    The sport was partly what led me to Stockholm where I ended up finding myself a very sweet Swede whom with I now share a nice little house and a beautiful boy. 
                    I still very much enjoy running orienteering but find it challenging to find the time working full time and having a 1.5 year old boy. 
                </p>
                <p>Besides orienteering, I really enjoy being in nature with my family and friends - hiking,  cross country skiing, downhill skiing, cooking over open fire and so on.</p>
